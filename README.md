I developed a Hangman game in Python. Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players attempt to uncover a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of guesses. 
The game offers an engaging and interactive way to enhance vocabulary and spelling skills. Each incorrect guess brings the visual representation of the hangman closer to completion.
